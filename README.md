# 32c3

Dear lovely Rubyists,

after our first assembly at the Congress last year, we want to do that again <3

We will collect all information here in this repo.

### Register for our Assenbly at the Congress
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:Rubytown
It's a bit tricky: 
First, you have to create a profile in the wiki and say that you are member of the Rubytown Assembly.
After confirming your profile, go back to the assembly page, click on the arrow right of the star and then click "Refresh". Now you should see you name in the member list.
