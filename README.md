# CCC: 32c3

**The 32th Chaos Communication Congress from December 27th to 30th, 2015**

Dear lovely Rubyists,

We will collect all information here in this repo.

### Register for our Assembly at the Congress
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Assembly:Rubytown
It's a bit tricky:
First, you have to create a profile in the wiki and say that you are member of the Rubytown Assembly.
After confirming your profile, go back to the assembly page, click on the arrow right of the star and then click "Refresh". Now you should see you name in the member list.
